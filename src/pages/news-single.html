          <p>The Ulster team were delighted to host Mr Armando López and Mr Hector Castelán from Cántaro Azul, when they visited Ulster University for two weeks in February.</p>
          <p>Armando is Technology Co-ordinator and designs innovative technologies which can be used for water treatment systems and Hector is Water Quality Area Co-ordinator and oversees water quality analysis.</p>
          <p>Hector spent one week at NICHE with Dr Bill Snelling gaining training in molecular biology techniques; then one week in NIBEC with Dr Jeremy Hamilton training on water quality devices. Armando spent two weeks in NIBEC receiving training from Dr Helen Lubarsky in the assessment of reactors for the removal of pathogens including bacteriophage. Two engagement events were held, a lunchtime seminar at Coleraine and a workshop in NIBEC, where Hector and Armando shared their experience of providing water treatment solutions in rural Mexico. Both events provided Ulster staff with critical insight into the challenge associated with the provision of safe water in resource limited settings. &nbsp;Hector and Armando also participated in the Northern Ireland Science Festival’s Health Technologies Futures event in NIBEC on Friday 15 February with 120 P7 school children visiting the SAFEWATER expo which demonstrated a specially constructed rural Mexican kitchen, with an augmented reality movie developed by Cántaro Azul helping visitors to understand the conditions faced by millions of people in rural Mexico.</p>
